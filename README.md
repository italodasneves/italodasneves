<h1>Hello everyone! I'm Italo! 💚💛</h1>

<p>
  - 🌍 I'm a brasilian beginer developer, currently working as network administrator at a firm called Largo.inc in Brazil. <br>
  - 💻 I decided to learning programming since I write my first HTML/CSS code. I think I had loved it so much, becouse I'm a creative person with great sense of inovation, and code is a good form of expression. 
</p> <br>
<p>
  - 💭 What I'm really looking for, is to change my carrer being prepared for when I start aplly for júnior Front-end developer jobs.
